                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Myth of Creation and Destruction:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Duology and Destruction<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true god created all and the end will come on all mortal planes, not with the armies of destruction and death and most certainly not with the fires of wraith, but in soft and sweet sound of our mother god in a blink of an eye. All is created in numerous times and it will be created numerous more times with inevitable end with them.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duology, on the other hand, is the core of the process of creation and destruction. The Creator split its living aspect into two and send them into the Calen. In every particular process of creation these twin souls find themselves and as a result of some random sequence of events, they engage in battle. Well, it is pretty much certain that if they are fighting the end is near. Destruction of one of the divine souls breaks down the entire balance of the creation and fabric of the universe starts to decay. In a very short time the creation collapses into void.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are ways to preserve information to the other processes. The best way is to write scrolls similar to this one and create a material protection field around it. In the event of destruction, the scroll is still become uncreated, but in the other creations it can be retrievable by magic.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
