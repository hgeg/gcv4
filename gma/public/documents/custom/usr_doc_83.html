                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blacksmith's Guide, Volume 1: Forging Basics<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golgan Bal-Merog, Royal Blacksmith of Farman.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the fires and on the anvils of Palindor's blacksmiths that weapons and tools of metal are crafted. Their work is in demand at all times in nearly every location, whether it be hammering the blade of a sword at the forge, or whetting the edge of an axe at camp.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tradition itself stretches back to the realm's Age of Bronze, though the advanced metallurgical techniques passed on from master to apprentice today bear little resemblance to the simple practices of ancient times. The relatively recent birth of firearms has created an entirely new area of expertise which is being adopted with fervor by many ambitious members of the guild. The primary tool of the blacksmith is the cross-pein hammer.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blacksmithing techniques are capable of weakening enemies constructed of metal, as well as discovering loot that would otherwise be overlooked by the untrained eye. Blacksmiths provide an edge to themselves and others by ensuring that weapons are always kept in optimal condition.
