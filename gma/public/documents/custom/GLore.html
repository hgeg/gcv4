<h1>Chaoran Lore</h1>
<h3>By Olrod Man Veid</h3>
<h3>~</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through my journeys and research, I finally managed to classify the events took place in "Chaoran History" and arrange these events
 in a correct chronological order. This book is a collection of my articles written one history, demography and geology of Kalandor,
 the continent of Great Empire of Chaora. </p>
 <h3>Prologue</h3>
 <h4>A Brief Essay on Prehistoric Ages of Ghanadea.</h4>
 
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the sorveign of men, a demigod folk called "Titans" ruled all over Ghanadea. Titans were referred as
 humanoid giants with prodigious potential of magicka in Ancient Scripts of Me'Ghon'u. Old ancestors of the elf-folk
,namely "Eldan", were the only ones that have written source about Titans. In Me'Ghon'u, the phrase "The Book" is
referred in many passages and it may refer to the great magic-book or collection of magical scriptures originally written
by the "Titans" themselves. Some parts of these scriptures are now possesed by some of the greatest mages and sorcerers in our time
and it is said that these fragments of papers itself has massive powers let alone the runes scripted on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Titans" ruled not only their kind on this world but also the world itself. They bent and shaped the enviroment in the way they need.
The "Ancient One", dissented king and life-long dictator of the "Titans" is the only individual mentioned in the scripts. It was the only one
 who have the unique power of creating life. So It created other "Titans". Due to the unknown reasons the 2nd generation titans, those twelwe "Titans" created by
 the "Ancient One", had lesser power than their creator. One of the two theories is the "Ancient One" did not want their creations be more powerful than It. On the contrary,
 second theory asserts that although It was the most powerful "Titan" that ever exist, It's powers were also limited. So It was incapable of creating Its siblings instead of
 Its children. I found this theory more reasonable than the other one. In the scriptions, the "Ancient One" portrayed as more like a Prophet than a king. It was humble, kind
 patient being who was "cursed to be the ruler of his kind"(Me'Ghon'u sc.79-4,5). Therefore his personality contradicts with the first theory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2nd generation of "Titans" were loyal to their king. after creation of 3rd and 4th generations. They formed the upper layer of
 their society where 4th generation "Titans" treated like slaves. The "Ancient One" was seeing the conflicts in the society and It warned its 12 overlords to be cautious.
 It was also against this solid hierarchy in the society. Its overlords, stood against It and declared war upon those who take side by the "Ancient One". This event
 is called "Rwang'an M'eu", "Heresy of the Children". </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through endless wars, the power of the "Ancient One" was exhausted. Millions of Millions of his people died in these wars. "Titans"
were at the edge of extinction. The environment became dangerous war zone. The "Ancient One" decided to end this war and It realized that the only way to do it
was Sacrificing itself and let the others live. So it surrendered to the overlords. They killed him and detached 4 parts to be sent to 4 reigons of the "Kingdom of Titans".
However, after the death of the "Ancient One". The "Titans" rapidly died all over the "Ghanadea" and "Titan-kind" extincted into oblivion. The Legends say that
the 4 pieces of the "Ancient One" transformed into the 4 elements that forms "Ghanadea". "His blood became the water, his soul became the fire and went to the sky,
his last breath spreaded and became the air and his body dissolved to form the earth and nature."(Me'Ghon'u sc.971-7,9)</p>
