Hello, 

I am a junior year CS student looking for an internship and I found your job offer. I have a passion for developing applications with Python
(especially web-based) as I have been developing with Python for several years, mostly in non-professional manner. Also, I am using JoliOS about
a year now and I am very excited that now I have a chance to develop applications for it as an intern. I find HTML5 and related technologies
breathtaking in such a way that the accomplishments they had in couple of years are enormous. I am trying to get along with these concepts
in order to take a place in this process of development in web technologies.

So, I can assure you I am right person for this job and eagerly waiting for your reply.
